<p>
  The JAX-WS client-side library may be used to access the SOAP API for this application via
  the Java runtime, using <a href="https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/">JAX-WS</a>. This is a slim, light,
  client library with minimal dependency bloat (as of Java 6, JAX-WS ships with the JDK), but
  it requires Java 5+.

<p>
  The JAX-WS client-side library is also used to provide the set of Java objects that can be serialized
  to/from XML using <a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB</a>.  This is useful for accessing the
  REST endpoints that are published by this application.
