<p>
  The JAX-WS client-side library may be used to access the SOAP API for this application via
  the Java runtime, using <a href="https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/">JAX-WS</a>. This may reduce the
  dependency bloat over the other Java libraries (as of Java 6, JAX-WS ships with the JDK), but
  it requires Java 5+.
