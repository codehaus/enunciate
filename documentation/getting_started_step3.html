      <h1>Step 3: Take a Look</h1>

      <p>You'll notice that we exported the war artifact that was created by Enunciate to the file "ifyouwannabecool.war" (with the option
        "-Espring.war.file ifyouwannabecool.war").  Drop that into your favorite J2EE container and hit the app in a browser to see
        what you've got!</p>
      
      <p>(For the majority of you who aren't actually performing the steps, you can see the static elements by <a href="wannabecool/step1/index.html">clicking
        here</a>.)</p>

      <p>The first thing you'll notice is a nice-looking web page with a generic title divided into two sections.  The first section describes the REST API,
      and it includes the two services we just wrote.  The second section is the data section describing our domain.  You'll notice the XML-Schema file that
      was generated that describe our domain.</p>

      <p>As you continue to poke around, you'll notice that the documentation is quite sparse (although some information can be gleaned
        from the names of the methods and arguments).</p>  

      <p>The "downloads" page links to client-side binaries and source code that can be used to access your REST API.  These client-side libraries were generated by
        Enunciate and packaged up (along with everything else) in the war.  The client-side code is clean, intuitive, and powerful, handling all
        the complexities of the API.</p>

      <p>Oh, and of course the endpoints are deployed as described in the documentation.</p>
