        <p><b>Enunciate 1.9 Released!</b></p>
        <p>Enunciate 1.9 provides support for <a href="module_cxf.html">CXF</a> and the <a href="module_jaxws_ri.html">JAX-WS reference implementation</a> as
          alternative engines for the SOAP endpoints. A <a href="module_jaxws_client.html">JAX-WS client-side module</a> is also provided for generating a
          lightweight client-side invocation library of the Web service endpoints.</p>

      <h1>The Basics</h1>

      <p>Enunciate is an engine for creating, maintaining, and deploying your rich Web service API for the Java
        platform.</p>

      <p>If that sounds complicated, it's not. All you have to do is define your service interfaces in Java source
        code. Make sure it's well-documented and that the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html">metadata</a> is
        correct, but don't worry about deployment descriptors, servlet configuration, packaging, or even interoperability.</p>

      <p>Then invoke Enunciate.</p>

      <p>Enunciate will build your web application <a href="http://webcohesion.com/compiled_contract.html">and enforce its
        interoperability</a>.  And the app will include some impressive features, too:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Full HTML documentation of your services.</li>
        <li>The endpoint(s) published via SOAP, REST, JSON, <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT-RPC</a>, and <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Message_Format">AMF</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Client-side libraries for rich client support.</li>
        <li>Interface Definition Documents (e.g. WSDL, XML-Schema, etc.)</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>An Example</h1>

      <p>So let's say you're developing a rich <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a> client using <a
        href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a>, and you've got to make some asynchronous
        Web service calls to your server. You've got your service interfaces defined in Java, and you need to
        make those interfaces available to your client. Sure, you could use <a href="https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/">JAX-WS</a> to
        publish your services via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a>. Or you could use
        <a href="http://www.restlet.org/">RESTlet</a> or <a href="https://jersey.dev.java.net/">Jersey</a> to make them available
        via REST. Or perhaps you optimize for Flex and use <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/blazeds/">BlazeDS</a> to publish
        your services as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Message_Format">AMF</a> endpoints.</p>

      <p>But for any of these choices, you've got to deal with the mess of deployment descriptors and keeping
        your documentation up-to-date. And let's face it, the Flex code you write isn't going to be pretty, since
        you'll be working with remote calls and loosly-typed objects.</p>

      <p>This is a case where Enunciate is designed to make your life easier. Enunciate deals with
        your deployment difficulties, documentation, and client-side code. By using Enunciate to publish your service
        interfaces, not only will you have <i>all three</i> Web service interfaces (SOAP, REST, and AMF), but you'll
        also have full up-to-date documentation and generated, strongly typed ActionScript code that you can use
        to invoke your remote services from your Flex code. And it's all nicely packaged in a standard war that
        you can drop in your favorite application server.</p>

      <p>There are many more cases where Enunciate can be applied.  Whether you're developing a public API for application-to-application
        development, creating an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a> application, or providing
        secure data to affiliate applications via <a href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a>, Enunciate will simplify both server-side and client-side
        development--<i>without</i> having to learn a any new development frameworks or libraries.</p>

      <h1>How</h1>

      <p>Enunciate's novel approach to Web service development centers around leveraging all components of an API that are
        definied and maintained in <i>original source code</i> (as opposed to only those that are defined by compiled bytecode).
        <u>This means that Web service development is done completely in source code</u>, where it can be maintained using your
        favorite IDE and where the development entry barrier is low.</p>

      <p>However, by starting with original source code, Enunciate avoids the interoperabilty issues of code-first development
        by forcing developers <i>at compile time</i> to reconcile any ambiguities or other potential hazards in the
        formal contract.  This model is formalized as the <a href="http://www.webcohesion.com/compiled_contract.html">
        "compiled contract" development model</a>.</p>

      <p>Of course, ease of development is not the only benefit of Enunciate's unique new approach to Web service development...</p>

      <h1>Features</h1>

      <p>Starting from original source code allows Enunciate to provide an attractive set of capabilities and features far
        beyond your average WS stack.  These include the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Full User Documentation</h3>
          <p>
            Enunciate will generate <b>full user-level documentation</b> to describe your web API.  The content for the documentation is
            taken from the documentation of the original source code (i.e. <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javadoc/index.html">Javadoc</a>),
            consolidating the maintenance of your entire Web service contract to a single place. The documentation is in the form of both HTML docs
            and documentation for the generated client-side code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Multiple Endpoints: SOAP, REST, JSON, GWT-RPC, AMF, etc.</h3>
          <p>Enunciate will publish your endpoint class as a <b>SOAP endpoint</b> as defined by the JAX-WS annotations.
            By supplying additional metadata, the same endpoint class will be published
            as a <b>XML REST endpoint</b> at a different URL.  Furthermore, certain REST endpoints will be automatically available as JSON
            endpoints at yet another URL. Enunciate supports both <a href="https://jsr311.dev.java.net/">JAX-RS</a> metadata or its own set
            of metadata, so take your pick or mix and match. See the <a href="module_jersey.html">Jersey module documentation</a> or the
            <a href="module_rest.html">REST module documentation</a> for more information.
          </p>
          <p>
            By enabling the <a href="module_gwt.html">GWT module</a>, your endpoints will be published via
            <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT-RPC</a> along with the client-side GWT code for invoking those endpoints via AJAX.
          </p>
          <p>
            By enabling the <a href="module_amf.html">AMF module</a>, your endpoints will be published via
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Message_Format">AMF</a> and client-side ActionScript classes will be generated for Flex developers.
            Enunciate will even compile your Flex application, according to the configuration.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Client Code Generation</h3>
          <p>
            Enunciate will generate <b>client-side code</b> to interface remotely with your published API.  Not only is
            the generated code <b>fully documented</b>, but it is simple, elegant and efficient.  Enunciate does not generate
            client code from the WSDL but instead reflects it from the original source code, allowing code documentation to be carried over
            and preserving valuable information like method signatures, class structure, and variable names.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, Enunciate generates code for the Java 1.4 platform and the Java 5 platform, but has plans to add modules that
            generate code for other platforms (.NET, C++, PHP, etc.) in the future.  Consult the
            <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ENUNCIATE/Roadmap">roadmap</a> for information on other modules in the pipe and how you can help.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Clean, Consolidated Interface Definition Documents</h3>
          <p>
            The common WS stack will provide a WSDL for an endpoint when queried.  Generally, the WSDL is generated at runtime, the
            associated schema is inline, the semantic constructs (i.e. namespaces, message names, argument ids, etc.) are awkward
            and inconsistent, and the scope is limited to that specific endpoint.  The XML contract is difficult to interpret (especially
            when being consumed for client-side stubs) and doesn't give a consolidated picture of the whole API because it has no reference
            to other endpoints and schema data that service the same namespace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enunciate generates the formalized XML contract at compile-time, providing for a <b>consolidated, efficient XML definition</b>.
            Core schema data is consolidated into a single set of schema documents (grouped by namespace), and multiple endpoints
            that service the same namespace are put into a single WSDL.  This allows for a wider, cleaner picture of the formal contract
            and relieves the consumer of the consolidation work.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Full App Packaging</h3>

          <p>Enunciate packages your API, extended with each of the above features, into a <b>single web application archive</b> (war file), powered by
            <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a>.  Drop the war file into your favorite J2EE container, and consider your web API enunciated.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Design and Philosophy</h1>

      <p>Enunciate boasts a clean, well-tested, modular design with loosely-coupled and easily extensible components, with a strong focus on
        testability.  The Enunciate engine is highly configurable but supplies a reasonable default configuration so as not to require
        complexity.  Enunciate aims to maintain a low entry barrier by adhering to published and proven standards and technologies so
        developers don't have to learn a new technology to be effective.
      </p>

      <p><u>Enunciate's primary goal is to enable the Web service developer without being obtrusive.</u></p>
