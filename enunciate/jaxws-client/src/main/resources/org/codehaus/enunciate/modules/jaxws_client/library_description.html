  Introduction
</h1>

<p>
  The JAX-WS client-side library may be used to access the SOAP API for this application via
  the Java runtime, using <a href="https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/">JAX-WS</a>. This is a slim, light,
  client library with minimal dependency bloat (as of Java 6, JAX-WS ships with the JDK), but
  it requires Java 5+.
</p>

<p>
  The JAX-WS client-side library is also used to provide the set of Java objects that can be serialized
  to/from XML using <a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB</a>.  This is useful for accessing the
  REST endpoints that are published by this application.

<h1>
    JAX-WS Example
</h1>

<code>
//instantiate a new service with an impl
// (or through dependency injection, or whatever)...
com.company.PurchaseOrderService service =
  new com.company.impl.PurchaseOrderServiceImpl();

//make the remote call to read the purchase order...
com.company.PurchaseOrder order =
  service.readPurchaseOrder("123456");

//handle the purchase order as needed...
</code>

<h1>
  REST Example (Standard JAXB)
</h1>

<code>
//read a purchase order from a REST url
java.net.URL url = ...;
JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(
  com.company.PurchaseOrder.class
)

Unmarshaller unmarshaller =
  context.createUnmarshaller();

com.company.PurchaseOrder order =
  (com.company.PurchaseOrder)
  unmarshaller.unmarshal( url );

//handle the purchase order as needed...
</code>

<h1>
  REST Example (Jersey client)
</h1>

<code>
com.sun.jersey.api.client.Client client =
  com.sun.jersey.api.client.Client.create();

com.company.PurchaseOrder order =
  client.resource("http://path/to/purchase/order")
  .get(com.company.PurchaseOrder.class);

//handle the purchase order as needed...
</code>
