/**
 * This API is a sample API that is intended to exercise Enunciate.  It has <i>a lot</i>
 * of relatively obscure cases that probably won't be used very much, including:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>one-way methods</li>
 *   <li>collections as operation parameters</li>
 *   <li>REST nouns and verbs</li>
 *   <li>RPC/lit methods</li>
 *   <li>SOAP headers</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This text should be showing up in the index page under the "introduction" section.
