The following were noticed inconsistencies in the JAXB specification:

-What if a web method is RPC/literal but one of the parameters is an instance of java.util.Collection?
-Are header elements required to be root elements?
-property order isn't guaranteed, so why isn't the propOrder annotation element required when generating the jaxws wrapper classes?
-jaxb: the @XmlSchemaType and @XmlSchemaTypes annotation at the package-level take a class which might not be compiled or loadable at pre-compile time...
-jaxb: what do you do with elements and elementWrappers that have different namespaces than their type definitions?  How do you create a schema for that?
-jaxb: what if you have a parametric collection of JAXBElements?  Assumption: The rule that any root elements that subclass it should be choices doesn't apply
       and JAXBElement should not be a valid type() for @XmlElementRef
