The following were noticed inconsistencies in the specifications:

-jaxws: What if a web method is RPC/literal but one of the parameters is an instance of java.util.Collection?
-jaxws: Are header elements required to be root elements?
-jaxws: property order isn't guaranteed, so why isn't the propOrder annotation element required when generating the jaxws wrapper classes?

-jaxb: the @XmlSchemaType and @XmlSchemaTypes annotation at the package-level take a class which might not be compiled or loadable at pre-compile time...
-jaxb: what if you have a parametric collection of JAXBElements?  Assumption: The rule that any root elements that subclass it should be choices doesn't apply
       and JAXBElement should not be a valid type() for @XmlElementRef
-jaxb: what if attributeFormDefault is NOT "qualified", the namespace for the attribute is the default namespace, but the namespace for the type definition is
       NOT the default namespace?  Assumption: this is NOT a case where it is an attribute ref, as specified in the jaxb spec, 8.9.7.2.
-jaxb: it is assumed that the namespace for the element wrapper defaults to the empty namespace if elementFormDefault is not qualified, or the namespace of
       the containing type definition if it is qualified.
-jaxb: the @XmlSchema annotation: it's scope is unclear: does it apply to all elements and types that belong to its namespace (schema scope) or is its application
       limited to the classes that are within its package (package scope, in which case the namespace is simply used to supply the default, and the
       elementFormDefault, attributeFormDefault, and xmlns values *could* apply to a schema of a different namespace).  Assumption: schema-scope, and its
       an error to have different values of elementFormDefault, attributeFormDefault, and xmlns with two different @XmlSchema annotations that apply to the
       same schema.
-jaxb: *why* does @XmlElement.namespace() exist?  If elementFormDefault is qualified, the namespace is the same as the type.  Otherwise, its the default namespace!
       what do you do with elements and elementWrappers that have different namespaces than their type definitions?  How do you create a schema for that?
-jaxb: why the contstraint that if it is a parameterized collection, then value.length must be one?  What if it's a parameterized collection of objects that
       all inherit from collection item type?
