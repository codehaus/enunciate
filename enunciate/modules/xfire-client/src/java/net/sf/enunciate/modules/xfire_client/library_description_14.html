    Introduction
  </h1>

  <p>
    The JDK 1.4 client-side library may be used to access the SOAP API for this application via
    the Java runtime.  This library is compatible with <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a>,
    version 1.4 and later.
  </p>

  <p>
    The library is divided into service interfaces, service implementations, and service data.  The
    service interfaces exist for convenience in testing and for possible
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">aspect</a> injection.  The
    service implementations and service data are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POJO">POJO</a>s,
    making them easy to understand and straightforward to use.  (The services can easily be
    declared in a <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a> beans configuration file,
    for example.)
  </p>

  <p>
    As an example, suppose there existed a service interface and method for reading a purchase order.
    Assuming the package "com.company", a typical use of the library would like like this:
  </p>

  <h1>
    Example
  </h1>

  <code>
//instantiate a new service with an impl
// (or through dependency injection, or whatever)...
com.company.PurchaseOrderService service =
  new com.company.impl.PurchaseOrderServiceImpl();

//make the remote call to read the purchase order...
com.company.PurchaseOrder order =
  service.readPurchaseOrder("123456");

//handle the purchase order as needed...
  </code>

    Dependencies
  </h1>

  <p>
    These client-side classes have runtime dependencies on libraries external to the JVM.  These
    libraries must be included on the classpath when consuming this client-side API.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>XFire</b> is used as the SOAP stack engine.  It, in turn, has dependencies on
      other libraries.  At the time of this writing, the known dependencies were the activation
      framework jars, jdom, woodstox, commons-codec, and commons-httpclient.  However, please
      consult the dependency guide for the xfire version you are using.  XFire and its dependencies
      can be <a href="http://xfire.codehaus.org/">downloaded from the codehaus</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Enunciate XFire Client Tools</b> is a small set of classes used as tools to enable the
      correct and compatible remote invocations.  This jar can be downloaded from the Enunciate
      home page.</li>
  </ul>
