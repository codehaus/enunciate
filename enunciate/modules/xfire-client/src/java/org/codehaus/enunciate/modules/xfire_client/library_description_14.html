  <p>
    The JDK 1.4 client-side library may be used to access the SOAP API for this application via
    the Java runtime.  This library is compatible with <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a>,
    version 1.4 and later.
  </p>

  <p>
    The library is divided into service interfaces, service implementations, and service data.  The
    service interfaces exist for convenience in testing and for possible
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">aspect</a> injection.  The
    service implementations and service data are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POJO">POJO</a>s,
    making them easy to understand and straightforward to use.  (The services can easily be
    declared in a <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a> beans configuration file,
    for example.)
  </p>

  <p>
    As an example, suppose there existed a service interface and method for reading a purchase order.
    Assuming the package "com.company", a typical use of the library would like like this:

    Example
  </h1>

  <code>
//instantiate a new service with an impl
// (or through dependency injection, or whatever)...
com.company.PurchaseOrderService service =
  new com.company.impl.PurchaseOrderServiceImpl();

//make the remote call to read the purchase order...
com.company.PurchaseOrder order =
  service.readPurchaseOrder("123456");

//handle the purchase order as needed...
  </code>
