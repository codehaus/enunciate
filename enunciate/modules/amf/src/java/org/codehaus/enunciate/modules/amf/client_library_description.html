    The ActionScript client bundle is a zip file containing the source files for the ActionScript classes that
    can be used with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Adobe Flex</a> to develop, for example, a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a> UI that interfaces with this public API. The ActionScript
    classes have been generated with an emphasis on usability, clarity, and type safety (inasmuch as ActionScript allows it).
    All public data types have been generated along with the services that access them. This means that rather than

  <p>
    As an example, suppose there existed a service interface and method for reading a purchase order.
    A typical use of the library would like like this:

    Example
  </h1>

  <code>
//instantiate a new service...
PurchaseOrderService service =
  new PurchaseOrderService();

//make the asynchronous remote call to read the purchase order...
service.readPurchaseOrder("123456",
  new PurchaseOrderService.ReadPurchaseOrderResponseCallback() {
    onResponse(PurchaseOrder po) {
      //handle the purchase order as needed...
    }

    onError(Throwable error) {
      //handle the error as needed...
    }
});
  </code>

  <p>You would then compile this code using the GWT.</p>
