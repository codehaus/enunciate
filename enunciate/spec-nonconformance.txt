-no support for rpc-style invocations
-no support for out or in/out parameters (for now).
-wsdl: default part name for the parameter is the name of the parameter, rather than arg0, arg1, etc.  The spec isn't clear whether the "arg0" naming is a MUST, so we'll take it as a suggestion.
-jaxb: xmlns at the package-level is global for across-the-board consistence and overridden by the enunciate.xml config file.
-jaxb: elementFormDefault/attributeFormDefault at the package-level is global for across-the-board consistence and overridden by the enunciate.xml config file.
-jaxb: no support yet for @XmlAdapter.
-jaxb: xs:all compositor is never used because it's unclear how to extends types with the xs:all compositor and it's also unclear what to do when maxOccurs > 1
-jaxb: no support for the exception that a property of type java.lang.List doesn't need a setter.
-jaxws: request wrappers, response wrappers, and web parameters each have to have the same target namespace as their associated endpoint interfaces.  However, BARE web parameters may be root elements in another namespace.
-jaxws: endpoint interfaces cannot throw web faults that are declared to be in a different target namespace.  If an exception is thrown in endpoint interfaces with different target namespaces, it must not have the targetNamespace element value declared in a @WebFault annotation.  If a fault with a specific target namespace is needed to be thrown in more than one endpoint interface, make it match the pattern described in section 2.5 of the JAX-WS spec.
