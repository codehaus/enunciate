-no support for out or in/out parameters (for now).
-support for only document/literal "wrapped" method invocations (for now).
-wsdl: default part name for the parameter is the name of the parameter, rather than arg0, arg1, etc.  The spec isn't clear whether the "arg0" naming is a MUST, so we'll take it as a suggestion.
-jaxb: xmlns is ignored for across-the-board consistence through the enunciate.xml config file.
