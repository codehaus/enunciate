-jaxb: no support yet for @XmlAdapter.
-jaxb: no support for java.util.Map.
-jaxb: xs:all compositor is never used because it's unclear how to extends types with the xs:all compositor and it's also unclear what to do when maxOccurs > 1
-jaxb: no support for the exception that a property of type java.lang.List doesn't need a setter.
-jaxb: the xml module doesn't support elements and attributes that are a different namespace than their type definitions, with the single exception that the namespace is the default namespace and the element/attribute form is not "qualified".
-jaxb: no support for element refs unless the element refs is a global element.
-jaxb: the xfire client module doesn't support java.awt.Image yet.
-jaxb: the xfire client module doesn't support javax.xml.transform.Source yet.
-jaxws: the xfire client module doesn't support in/out and out parameters yet.
-jaxws: default part name for the parameter is the name of the parameter, rather than arg0, arg1, etc.  The spec isn't clear whether the "arg0" naming is a MUST, so we'll take it as a suggestion.
-jaxws: request wrappers, response wrappers, and web parameters each have to have the same target namespace as their associated endpoint interfaces.  However, BARE web parameters may be root elements in another namespace.
-jaxws: endpoint interfaces cannot throw web faults that are declared to be in a different target namespace.  If an exception is thrown in endpoint interfaces with different target namespaces, it must not have the targetNamespace element value declared in a @WebFault annotation.  If a fault with a specific target namespace is needed to be thrown in more than one endpoint interface, make it match the pattern described in section 2.5 of the JAX-WS spec.
