      <h1>The Basics</h1>

      <p>Here's the deal: you develop your complete Web API in source code.  Make sure it's well-documented and that the
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html">metadata</a> is correct, but don't
        worry about deployment descriptors, servlet configuration, packaging, or even interoperability.</p>

      <p>Then invoke Enunciate.</p>

      <p>Enunciate will build your web application <a href="http://sanitystack.blogspot.com/2007/03/on-compiled-contract.html">and enforce its
        interoperability</a>.  And the app will include some impressive features, too:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Full user documentation</li>
        <li>Consolidated, annotated WSDL(s) referencing a common set of schemas</li>
        <li>The same endpoint(s) published via SOAP, REST, and JSON</li>
        <li>Client-side libraries for download</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>The Details</h1>

      <p><b>Enunciate</b> is a Web service deployment framework. It is <i>not</i> another Web service stack implementation.
        Rather, Enunciate leverages existing Web service technologies to provide a mechanism to build, package, deploy,
        and to clearly, accurately deliver your Web service API on the Java platform.</p>

      <p>Enunciate's novel approach to Web service development centers around leveraging all components of an API that are
        definied and maintained in <i>original source code</i> (as opposed to only those that are defined by compiled bytecode).
        <u>This means that Web service development is done completely in source code</u>, where it can be maintained using your
        favorite IDE and where the development entry barrier is low.</p>

      <p>However, by starting with original source code, Enunciate avoids the interoperabilty issues of code-first development
        by forcing developers <i>at compile time</i> to reconcile any ambiguities or other potential hazards in the
        formal contract.  This model is formalized as the <a href="http://www.webcohesion.com/compiled_contract.html">
        "compiled contract" development model</a>.</p>

      <p>Of course, ease of development is not the only benefit of Enunciate's unique new approach to Web service development...</p>

      <h1>Features</h1>

      <p>Starting from original source code allows Enunciate to provide an attractive set of capabilities and features far
        beyond your average WS stack.  These include the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Full User Documentation</h3>
          <p>
            Enunciate will generate <b>full user-level documentation</b> to describe your web API.  The content for the documentation is
            taken from the documentation of the original source code (i.e. <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javadoc/index.html">Javadoc</a>),
            consolidating the maintenance of your entire Web service contract to a single place. <a name="consolidated_contract">&nbsp;</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Consolidated, Annotated WSDL and Schemas</h3>
          <p>
            The common WS stack will provide a WSDL for an endpoint when queried.  Generally, the WSDL is generated at runtime, the
            associated schema is inline, the semantic constructs (i.e. namespaces, message names, argument ids, etc.) are awkward
            and inconsistent, and the scope is limited to that specific endpoint.  The XML contract is difficult to interpret (especially
            when being consumed for client-side stubs) and doesn't give a consolidated picture of the whole API because it has no reference
            to other endpoints and schema data that service the same namespace
            (<a href="http://tssblog.techtarget.com/index.php/uncategorized/a-rant-of-sorts-on-multiple-net-web-references/">click here for a more
            complete discussion</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Enunciate generates the formalized XML contract at compile-time, providing for a <b>consolidated, efficient XML definition</b>.
            Core schema data is consolidated into a single set of schema documents (grouped by namespace), and multiple endpoints
            that service the same namespace are put into a single WSDL.  This allows for a wider, cleaner picture of the formal contract
            and relieves the consumer of the consolidation work.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Multiple Endpoints: SOAP, REST, JSON, etc.</h3>
          <p>Enunciate will publish your endpoint class as a <b>SOAP endpoint</b> as defined by the JAX-WS annotations (powered by <a
            href="http://xfire.codehaus.org/">XFire</a>).  By supplying additional metadata, the same endpoint class will be published
            as a <b>XML REST endpoint</b> at a different URL.  Furthermore, certain REST endpoints will be automatically available as JSON
            endpoints at yet another URL.  See the <a href="module_rest.html">REST module documentation</a> for more information.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Client Code Generation</h3>
          <p>
            Enunciate will generate <b>client code for multiple platforms</b> to interface remotely with your published API.  Not only is
            the generated code <b>fully documented</b>, but it is simple, elegant and efficient.  Enunciate does not generate
            client code from the WSDL but instead reflects it from the original source code, allowing code documentation to be carried over
            and preserving valuable information like method signatures, class structure, and variable names.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, Enunciate generates code for the Java 1.4 platform and the Java 5 platform, but has plans to add modules that
            generate code for the .NET and C/C++ platforms in the future.  Consult the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ENUNCIATE/Roadmap">roadmap</a> for
            information on other modules in the pipe and how you can help.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Full App Packaging</h3>

          <p>Enunciate packages your API, extended with each of the above features, into a <b>single web application archive</b> (war file).  Drop the war
            file into your favorite J2EE container, and consider your web API enunciated.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Design and Philosophy</h1>

      <p>Enunciate boasts a clean, well-tested, modular design with loosely-coupled and easily extensible components, with a strong focus on
        testability.  The Enunciate engine is highly configurable but supplies a reasonable default configuration so as not to require
        complexity.  Enunciate aims to maintain a low entry barrier by adhering to published and proven standards and technologies so
        developers don't have to learn a new technology to be effective.
      </p>

      <p><u>Enunciate's primary goal is to enable the Web service developer without being obtrusive.</u></p>
