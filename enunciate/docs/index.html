  <h3 class="title">introduction</h3>

  <p><b>Enunciate</b> is a web service deployment framework. It is <i>not</i> another web service stack implementation. Rather, enunciate leverages the existing
    web service technologies to provide a mechanism to package, to deploy, and to clearly, accurately deliver your web service API.</p>

  <p>Enunciate's <a href="compiled_contract.html">"compiled contract" philosophy</a> reconciles the conflict between the code-first and WSDL-first convictions
    by enforcing a <i>WSDL-first mindset over a code-first implementation</i>.  The pith of the <a href="compiled_contract.html">"compiled contract"
    philosophy</a> is that while the web service API is developed and maintained in source code, developers are forced at compile time to reconcile any
    ambiguities or other potential hazards in the resulting authoritative XML contract.</p>

  <p>Currently, Enunciate supports only service endpoints written in Java that conform to the JAX-WS (JSR-181) specification.  In the future, Enunciate could be
  expanded to support service endpoints written in other languages (e.g. .NET).</p>

  <p>Enunciate provides an attractive set of capabilities and features, including the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Generation of fully-documented client code for multiple client platforms, including Java 5, Java 1.3+, .NET, and C++.</li>
    <li>Generation of a fully-annotated XML web service contract (i.e. WSDL with associated XML-Schema documents) from documented (i.e. JavaDoc) source code.</li>
    <li>Complete packaging of the API into a J2EE-compliant web archive (war) that includes full HTML documentation of the published services.</li>
    <li>Customization support for namespaces, schema locations, file names, and documentation sytylesheets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="title">background</h3>

  <p>Web services were once touted as the silver bullet....  Every vendor was anxious to get you to use their product and to make money... That
    was many years ago...  Then people starting figuring out that web services are not easy...</p>

  <p>Having said that, things have been getting better as people have repented and provided the means to think about what the XML looks like...  But there is
    still the interoperability issues...</p>

  <p>ta-da enunciate...</p>
