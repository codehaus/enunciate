The Enunciate 1.5 release includes some changes to the module structure.  Most notably, a new spring-app
module has been created by extracting the "application assembly" logic from the SOAP stack (XFire).  This
allows for clearer boundaries between how the Web service application is assembled and underlying
technologies that support it.  In the future, this will allow us to support alternate implementations
(e.g. CXF, Axis 2) and additional implementations (e.g. AMF).

For those of you who are migrating from 1.4 or earlier, you will need to make some minor adjustments to your
configuration file:

  1. All configuration that was applied to the "xfire" module has been moved to the "spring-app" module. For
  example, what was this:

  <enunciate>
    <modules>
      <xfire ...>
        <war ...>
          ...
        </war>
        ...
      </xfire>
    </modules>
  </enunciate>

  is now:

  <enunciate>
    <modules>
      <spring-app ...>
        <war ...>
          ...
        </war>
        ...
      </spring-app>
    </modules>
  </enunciate>

  2. Support for the "lib" child element of the "war" element has been removed.  Use "includeLibs" instead.
  3. The "excludeJars" child element of the "war" element has been renamed to "excludeLibs".
  4. The "jaxb-import" child element of the "enunciate" element has been renamed to be "api-import".
