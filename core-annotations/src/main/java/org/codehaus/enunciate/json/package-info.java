/**
 * <h2>Overview</h2>
 * <p>
 * Annotations that denote classes as serializable to JSON. These annotations are designed to be similar to those used in <a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB</a> and <a
 * href="http://jackson.codehaus.org/1.1.1/javadoc/org/codehaus/jackson/annotate/package-summary.html">Jackson</a>, but are meant to be neutral from a specific serialization engine. Ideally, in the
 * future, there will be a JSR similar to JAXB for the purpose of binding to JSON serialization.
