  <!--
    This is the definition for the token services that service the sparklr OAuth engine.  Since sparklr only
    runs on a single app server, we can use an in-memory implementation of the token services.  If the
    app were distributed among multiple app servers, you'd have to provide token services that make the tokens
    visible to all app servers.

    The in-memory token services spawn a separate thread that cleans up expired tokens.
