    Introduction

  <p>
    The ActionScript client bundle is an SWC containing the ActionScript classes that
    can be used with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Adobe Flex</a> to develop, for example, a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a> UI that interfaces with this public API. The ActionScript
    classes have been generated with an emphasis on usability, clarity, and type safety (inasmuch as ActionScript allows it).
    All public data types have been generated along with the services (if any) that access them.
  </p>

  <p>
    For any services, this means that rather than using a standard RemoteObject, you can instantiate a service, register the
    appropriate events, and invoke the method.  The service will fire the appropriate (strongly-typed) event that contains the response.
    Because the public client-side data types are also generated for ActionScript developers, these can be used to read and invoke any
    REST endpoints that provide the AMF content type (e.g. "application/x-amf").
  </p>

  <p>
    As an example, suppose there existed a service interface and method for reading a purchase order.
    A typical use of the library would like like this:
  </p>

  <h1>
    Services Example
  </h1>

  <code>
//instantiate a new service...
PurchaseOrderService service =
  new PurchaseOrderService();

service.addEventListener("readPurchaseOrder",
    doReadPurchaseOrder);
service.addEventListener("fault", doFault);

private function doFault(event:Event):void {
  Alert.show("A fault occurred.");
}

private function doReadPurchaseOrder
    (event:ReadPurchaseOrderResultEvent):void {
  PurchaseOrder po = event.result;
  //handle the purchase order that was returned.
}

//make the asynchronous remote call to
//read the purchase order...
service.readPurchaseOrder("123456");
  </code>

  <p>
    For the case of a REST endpoint, consider REST resource provided as "application/x-amf",
    mounted at a relative URL "po/12345":
  </p>

  <h1>
    REST Example
  </h1>

  <code>
var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest("po/12345");
request.method = URLRequestMethod.GET;
URLStream poStream = new URLStream();
poStream.addEventListener("complete", poRetrieved)
poStream.addEventListener("ioError", handleError)
try {
  contactStream.load(request);
}
catch (error:Error) {
  Alert.show(error.toString());
}

private function poRetrieved(event:Event):void {
  var stream:URLStream = URLStream( event.target );
  var po:PurchaseOrder = ( stream.readObject() as PurchaseOrder );
  //...handle the purchase order
}

private function handleError(event:Event):void {
  Alert.show("error.");
}

  </code>
